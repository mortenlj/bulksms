BulkSMS
=======

BulkSMS is a Supybot plugin to allow sending SMS-messages from IRC using the BulkSMS service at http://www.bulksms.com/.

It requires a "phonebook" URL where it can look up nick and number and get some contact details back. At the moment
it is tailored for use by the Planetarion_ alliance Howling Rain, and the contact details should also list a
preference for when the contact will allow messages: For defence, or only in emergencies. These preferences are
mapped to which channels are allowed to send SMS.
